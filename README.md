# Taiga Docker

## Getting Started

This section intends to explain how to get Taiga up and running in a simple two steps, using **docker** and **docker-compose**.

If you don't have docker installed, please follow installation instructions from docker.com: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Additionally, it's necessary to have familiarity with Docker, docker-compose and Docker repositories.

**Note** branch `stable` should be used to deploy Taiga in production and `master` branch for development purposes.

### Start the application

```sh
$ ./launch-all.sh
```

After some instants, when the application is started you can proceed to create the superuser with the following script:

```sh
$ ./taiga-manage.sh createsuperuser
```

The `taiga-manage.sh` script lets launch manage.py commands on the
back instance:

```sh
$ ./taiga-manage.sh [COMMAND]
```

Default access for the application is **http://localhost:9000**.

As **EXTRA**: the default `launch-all.sh` script comes with [penpot](https://penpot.app), the open-source solution for design and prototyping. The default access for the penpot application is **http://locahost:9001**

It's developed by the same team behind Taiga. If you want to give it a try, you can go to [penpot's github](https://github.com/penpot/penpot/tree/develop/docs) to review its own configuration variables.

And finally if you just want to launch Taiga standalone, you can use the `launch-taiga.sh` script instead of the `launch-all.sh`.

## Documentation

Currently, we have authored three main documentation hubs:

- **[API](https://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/api.html)**: Our API documentation and reference for developing from Taiga API.
- **[Documentation](https://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/)**: If you need to install Taiga on your own server, this is the place to find some guides.
- **[Taiga Resources](https://resources.taiga.io)**: This page is intended to be the support reference page for the users.

## Bug reports

If you **find a bug** in Taiga you can always report it:

- in [Taiga issues](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues). **This is the preferred way**
- in [Github issues](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-docker/issues)
- send us a mail to support@taiga.io if is a bug related to [tree.taiga.io](https://tree.taiga.io)
- send us a mail to security@taiga.io if is a **security bug**

One of our fellow Taiga developers will search, find and hunt it as soon as possible.

Please, before reporting a bug, write down how can we reproduce it, your operating system, your browser and version, and if it's possible, a screenshot. Sometimes it takes less time to fix a bug if the developer knows how to find it.

## Community

## Configuration with Environment Variables

There are some environment variables for a simple customization. Find
them in the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-inits.yml`. The
images are ready to work out of the box, although is strongly
recommended to change some default values.

**Important** Don't forget to review environment variables in
`docker-compose-inits.yml` as some of them are in both files.

### taiga-db

##### `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_USE_TLS`, `EMAIL_USE_SSL`.

## Advanced customization (via configuration files)

For a advanced customization, you can use configuration files, mapped to specific directories inside the containers.

### taiga-back

Map a Python configuration file to `/taiga-back/settings/config.py`. You can use (this file)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taigaio/taiga-back/master/docker/config.py] as an example.

**Important**: if you use your own configuration file, don't forget to add contribs to `INSTALLED_APPS` (check the example `config.py`).

### taiga-front

Map a `conf.json`configuration file to `/usr/share/nginx/html/conf.json`. You can use (this file)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taigaio/taiga-front/master/docker/conf.json.template] as an example.
